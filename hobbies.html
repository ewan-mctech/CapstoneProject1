  I have a diverse range of hobbies that keep me active and engaged. I love
  hiking, exploring nature, and taking on new trails whenever I can.
</p>
<p>
  Mixed martial arts is another passion of mine, which i recently took part in a
  charity fight! My first one!( I won, check it out<a

  :)) This helped me stay fit while also honing discipline and technique, losing
  over 15kg in less than a year.

<p>
  Gaming is also a big part of my life and is a great way for me to unwind and
  challenge myself in different virtual worlds.

<p>
  I'm also a big football fan, whether it's playing on the field (more likely sitting on the bench) or watching a
  great match. 
  </p>
  <p>Im also semi musical, I play bass in a band, adding rhythm and
  depth to our sound, which is always a blast. Plus being in a band with your only brother can only lead to good things! (eh Noel?)
